# DWBI End to End Project
 🚀 Just wrapped up an exciting hands-on data project where I simulated a real-life retail scenario from scratch!

🔧 Tech Stack Used:

🐍 Python (to generate realistic synthetic data using libraries like Faker & Pandas)

❄️ Snowflake (for data warehousing and storage)

🧠 SQL (for data modeling, joins, aggregations)

📊 Power BI (for creating interactive dashboards and KPIs)

📦 Created multiple fact and dimension tables like DIMCUSTOMER, DIMSTORE, FACTORDERS, and joined them through meaningful relationships.

📈I've Built visuals for:

Sales by Region, Category, and Store

Order and Customer Trends

Discount vs Revenue Impact

Loyalty Program Analysis

This was a full data-to-dashboard pipeline, and it sharpened my skills in data engineering, warehousing, and BI.
